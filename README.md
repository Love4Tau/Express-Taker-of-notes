  # Express Taker-of-Notes

  ## Description
  In this project, I used express to retrieve and save data on the backend. The hardest part of this project for me was creating the get, post and delete requests. I had to refer to the cloud recordings for our bootcamp class and rewatch the mini project demo to figure out how I wanted to create these requests/routes. I also watched a ton of videos and read some articles on how to create post and get requests.
